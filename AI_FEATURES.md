# AI Features Documentation

## Overview
The AI-Powered Interview Assistant uses Google's Gemini AI to provide intelligent, context-aware interview experiences. The system includes robust fallbacks to ensure functionality even without an API key.

## ü§ñ AI Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Question Generation
- **Resume Analysis**: AI analyzes uploaded resume content to generate relevant questions
- **Position Matching**: Questions tailored to specific job positions (Frontend, Backend, Full-stack, etc.)
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Balanced mix of Easy (5min), Medium (7.5min), and Hard (9min) questions
- **Technical Focus**: Questions match candidate's technology stack and experience level

**Example Generated Questions:**
- For React Developer: "Explain how you would optimize a React component that's causing performance issues"
- For Backend Developer: "Design an API rate limiting system for a high-traffic application"
- For Full-stack: "Walk me through how you'd implement real-time notifications across frontend and backend"

### 2. Smart Answer Scoring
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Evaluates technical accuracy, completeness, communication clarity
- **Context Awareness**: Scoring considers question difficulty and time spent
- **Detailed Feedback**: Specific suggestions for improvement
- **Consistent Scoring**: AI maintains consistent evaluation criteria across all candidates

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Technical accuracy and depth (40%)
- Problem-solving approach (25%)
- Communication clarity (20%)
- Time management (15%)

### 3. Comprehensive Interview Summaries
- **Overall Assessment**: Holistic evaluation combining all question responses
- **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Detailed analysis of candidate's performance
- **Technical Competencies**: Assessment of specific technical skills demonstrated
- **Hiring Recommendation**: Clear recommendation (Strong Hire/Hire/No Hire) with justification

### 4. Natural Conversation Flow
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI maintains conversation context throughout interview
- **Encouraging Tone**: Professional, supportive interaction style
- **Clarifying Questions**: AI can ask follow-up questions when needed
- **Smooth Transitions**: Natural flow between questions and topics

## üîß Implementation Details

### AI Service Architecture
```typescript
class AIService {
  // Core AI methods
  generateQuestions(resumeText, position, difficulty)
  generateChatResponse(message, context)
  scoreAnswer(answer, question)
  generateInterviewSummary(interview, candidate)
  
  // Fallback methods (work without API key)
  generateLocalQuestions()
  generateLocalChatResponse()
  scoreAnswerLocal()
  generateLocalSummary()
}
```

### Gemini AI Integration
- **Model**: Uses `gemini-pro` for text generation and analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts for consistent, relevant outputs
- **JSON Parsing**: Structured response parsing for reliable data extraction
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when AI requests fail

### Local Fallback System
When no API key is provided or AI requests fail:
- **Question Bank**: Curated set of high-quality interview questions
- **Rule-based Scoring**: Keyword matching and heuristic-based evaluation
- **Template Responses**: Professional, contextual response templates
- **Local Summary Generation**: Algorithm-based performance assessment

## üöÄ Setup Guide

### Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**: Go to [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. **Sign In**: Use your Google account
3. **Create API Key**: Click "Create API Key" button
4. **Copy Key**: Save the generated key securely

### Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in project root
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Verification**:
   - Restart development server: `npm run dev`
   - Check console logs for "Using AI service" vs "Using fallback service"
   - Test question generation to see AI-powered vs local questions

### API Usage Monitoring
- **Free Tier**: 60 requests per minute, 1000 requests per day
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in handling for rate limit errors
- **Cost**: Free tier should be sufficient for development and testing

## üí° Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- **Clear Instructions**: Specific, detailed prompts for consistent outputs
- **JSON Structure**: Always request structured responses for reliable parsing
- **Context Inclusion**: Provide relevant context (resume, position, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Fallback parsing for malformed AI responses

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Consider implementing response caching for repeated requests
- **Batch Processing**: Group related AI requests when possible
- **Timeout Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for AI requests
- **Progressive Enhancement**: AI enhances but doesn't break core functionality

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize inputs before sending to AI
- **Response Validation**: Always validate AI responses before using
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement client-side limiting

## üîç Testing & Debugging

### Testing AI Features
```bash
# Test with AI (requires API key)
VITE_GEMINI_AI_KEY=your_key npm run dev

# Test without AI (fallback mode)
npm run dev
```

### Debug Logging
The AI service includes comprehensive logging:
- Question generation attempts and results
- Scoring analysis and feedback generation
- Summary creation process
- Fallback activations

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Invalid**: Check key format and permissions
2. **Rate Limits**: Implement delays between requests
3. **Response Parsing**: Handle malformed JSON responses
4. **Network Issues**: Always have fallback methods ready

## üìä Analytics & Insights

### Performance Metrics
- **AI vs Fallback Usage**: Track when AI is successfully used
- **Response Quality**: Monitor AI response relevance and accuracy
- **Processing Time**: Compare AI vs local processing speeds
- **Error Rates**: Track failed AI requests and fallback activations

### Continuous Improvement
- **Prompt Refinement**: Iteratively improve prompts based on outputs
